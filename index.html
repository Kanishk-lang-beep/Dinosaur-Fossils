          <p>The Triassic period, spanning from approximately 252 to 201 million years ago, marked the beginning of the Mesozoic Era. It was a time of recovery and diversification following the Permian-Triassic extinction event. Early dinosaurs began to emerge during this period, alongside other reptiles and amphibians.</p>
          <p>This period is characterized by hot, dry climates and the supercontinent Pangea, which allowed land animals to migrate freely across vast distances.</p>

        <div class="text-group">
          <p>The Jurassic period, lasting from about 201 to 145 million years ago, is often referred to as the "Age of Dinosaurs." During this time, dinosaurs became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates. The period saw the rise of iconic species such as Brachiosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Allosaurus. The first birds also appeared during this era.</p>
          <p>This period is famous for the dominance of huge sauropods and the proliferation of coniferous forests across the landscape.</p>

      <div class="period-content-wrapper">
        <div class="text-group">
          <p>The Cretaceous Period was the Mesozoic Era's last and longest period for 145 to 66 million years ago. The name comes from the Latin word *creta* near chalk. High temperatures and high seas marked the Cretaceous with more inland seas during any other time period. Dinosaurs, including apex predators such as T. rex and top herbivores such as Triceratops, became the dominant land vertebrates. Angiosperms or flowering plants arose during this period toward rapidly becoming dominant. The period ended at the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. A meteorite impact likely caused that event. This event eliminated all non-avian dinosaurs to conclude the "Age of Reptiles"</p>
          <p>This period saw the final, immense radiation of dinosaur species before the mass extinction event.</p>

      <h2>Fossils</h2>
      <div class="display-case">
        <ul>
          <li>Fossils are nature's time capsules — the mineralized remains or traces of ancient organisms. They preserve evidence of life that existed millions of years ago, allowing scientists to study the evolution of species and past ecosystems.</li>
          <li>They form when plants or animals are buried by sediment, and over time, minerals replace organic material. These fossils help paleontologists piece together the story of Earth’s ancient past.</li>

    <section id="extinction">
      <h2>Extinction Event</h2>
      <p>The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event occurred around 66 million years ago, leading to the mass extinction of approximately 75% of Earth's species, including all non-avian dinosaurs. This event is widely believed to have been caused by a combination of volcanic activity, climate change, and a massive asteroid impact.</p>
